**A** **R***eal*-**T***ime* **O***cean* **S***imulation* **E***ngine* written in Java that uses **OpenGL** and **OpenCL**.
## Description
This is an implementation of the [Gerstner waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochoidal_wave) algorithm in Java that uses a renderer I wrote in **OpenGL** and **OpenCL**.

### ðŸ“š Note
This project is meant for educational purposes. During the development I referenced the [Crest Unity Addon](https://github.com/wave-harmonic/crest) in order to understand the Gerstner waves algorithm as well as the general graphics pipeline and it's optimization.

# :hammer_and_wrench: Technical Details

- Uses an OpenGL renderer
- Uses OpenCL kernels to combine different wave frequencies into one texture
- Implements a Level of Detail system
- Has Sub Surface Scattering
- The Ocean mesh follows the camera allowing for infinite Oceans
- Currently only works on MacOS
